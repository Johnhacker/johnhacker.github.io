        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My write up notes reading John Rossman's book: The Amazon Way on IoT.</p>
<p>In this book, John Rossman proposed 10 principles to help business leaders and product owners implement successful IoT strategies.</p>
<p>IoT can be used to:</p>
<p>Improve customer experiences. 👉 Principle 1, 2
Improve and streamline operations. 👉 Principle 3, 4, 5
Develop new business models. 👉 Principle 6, 7, 8
And build disruptive IoT strategies in your industry. 👉 Principle 9, 10</p>
<p>Principle 1: Reinvent Customer Experiences with Connected Devices
Customer obsession is the first principle of Amazon Principles.</p>
<p>What is the connection between user experience and customer obsession? User experience builds customer obsession/trust. The customer obsession then leads to long-term profits.</p>
<p>What’s the difference between customer obsession and customer focus? Customer focus means a shiner, more-profitable short-term opportunity, while customer obsession means being willing to do really hard things just to make life easier for its customers.</p>
